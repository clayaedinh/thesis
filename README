Thesis: Blockchain Prescription


=== HOW TO INSTALL - CHAINCODE/APPLICATION ===

1) Install the latest versions of golang and docker desktop.
2) Run "./install-fabric.sh binary docker" to install the binaries and docker images. DO NOT install fabric-samples.

=== HOW TO INSTALL - HYPERLEDGER CALIPER ===

*** Caliper tests DO NOT WORK yet, as of February 19, 2023

1) Install latest versions of nodejs and npm

2) Run these commands inside caliper-workspace folder:
npm install --only=prod @hyperledger/caliper-cli
npx caliper bind --caliper-bind-sut fabric:2.4

=== HOW TO RUN ===

Some useful scripts are found in test-network/thesis_scripts.

=== GENERATING USERS ===
Ideally, users should be made using an SDK app that does the following steps:
- connect to chaincode, send requested username & password
- chaincode registers the user on peer
- sdk app enrolls user
- sdk app receives org msp config
- (RSA app only) sdk generates public/private key pair
- (RSA app only) user public key is sent to chaincode & stored in rsa key collection

However, implementing that is currently beyond me. Instead, the gen-testuser.sh script fakes  
this process on the local machine by using cd to switch back and forth between directories. There
is currently no mechanism to properly create users on a deployed version of this system.

Use gen-testuser.sh!
